# Git Challenge

You will be expected to be able to contribute features and fixes without causing conflicts and other version control headaches. An important tool for keeping codebases clean is `git rebase`. This challenge will test your understanding of a basic codebase and your ability to use `git rebase` properly.

## The Challenge

There are two pull requests open on this repo. Each change is in its own branch. The challenge is to use `git rebase` to add both changes to `master`. When you are finished, your `master` branch should have three commits in the following order:

```
* feat: add base64 endpoint
* feat: add user-agent endpoint
* fiat lux
```

_ Any errors, missing features, missing tests, or failing tests will disqualify the solution. _

## Instructions

4) Set your local origin to the new git url: `git remote set-url origin ${git url}`
